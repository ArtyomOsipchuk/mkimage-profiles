The Program may be used free of charge by the academic community under the
condition that it is not redistributed (just give the pointer to this
anonymous ftp server (xraysoft.chem.ruu.nl) for a current & fresh copy. The
author is interested in reports of misbehaviour and suggestions for
additional features.

There is a charge of US$ 5000 for commercial users (as a contribution to
our continuing research efforts).

Dear Michael,

I agee that the statements that you cite below are somewhat contradictory.

My main issue is that potential users work with the latest versions and
that the software remains free for Academics and not sold by other parties.

(Note: Dr Pascal Parois is currently working in our Lab)

Many potential users shy away from using the Native Linux version of PLATON
due to the need to know how to compile a program etc. For that reason, the
derived MS-Windows version is more popular.

I support attempts to create rpm's etc for various Linux platforms and have
no problem with ALT Linux making them available for academics.

Best wishes
